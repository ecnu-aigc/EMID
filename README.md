## Dataset Summary

**E**motionally paired **M**usic and **I**mage Dataset (**EMID**) is a novel dataset designed for the emotional matching of music and images. The EMID dataset contains 10,738 unique music clips, each of which is paired with 3 images in the same emotional categoryï¼Œas well as rich annotations. These musical clips are categorized into the 13 emotional categories proposed by [What music makes us feel: At least 13 dimensions organize subjective experiences associated with music across different cultures](https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1910704117), from which we obtain 1836 original music clips. Subsequently, we acquire images labeled with Mikels' eight emotions from [Building a Large Scale Dataset for Image Emotion Recognition: The Fine Print and The Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02677). Through the processing pipeline proposed in our paper, we expanded the original music clips and obtain the final dataset.
